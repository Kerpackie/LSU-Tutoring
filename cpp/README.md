# C++ Projects

This directory contains C++ applications, exercises, and code samples for tutoring sessions.

## Structure
- Each project should be in its own subdirectory
- Include a README.md for each project explaining its purpose and how to build/run it

## Getting Started
Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. You can check your installation with:
```bash
g++ --version
# or
clang++ --version
```
