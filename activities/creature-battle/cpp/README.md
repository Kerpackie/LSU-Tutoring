Of course! Here is the C++ version of the exercise, maintaining the same structure and instructions while adapting the concepts and syntax for C++.

## Exercise: Creature Battle Arena

This project involves creating a base `Creature` class and then specializing it into different types, like a `Dragon` and a `Goblin`. Finally, you'll create a `BattleArena` to make them fight! You will need to include the `<iostream>`, `<string>`, and `<random>` headers.

### Step 1: Create the Base `Creature` Class

First, let's create the foundation for all our creatures. This class will hold the common attributes and behaviors.

**Instructions:**
Create a Class named `Creature`. It should have the following:

* **Attributes (Member Variables):**
    * `name` (std::string): The creature's name.
    * `health` (int): Its current health points.
    * `attackPower` (int): How much damage it deals.
    * These should be `protected` so child classes can access them.
* **Constructor:**
    * A constructor that accepts `name`, `health`, and `attackPower` to initialize the object.
* **Methods (Member Functions):**
    * `attack(Creature* target)`: This method should reduce the `target` creature's health by the `attackPower` of the current creature. Print a message describing the attack (e.g., "Grog the Goblin attacks, dealing 5 damage!"). This method must be marked as `virtual`.
    * `takeDamage(int damage)`: Reduces the creature's `health` by the `damage` amount. This method must also be `virtual`.
    * `isAlive()`: Returns `true` if `health` is greater than 0, otherwise `false`.
    * `display()`: Prints the creature's status (e.g., "Name: Grog, Health: 15/20, Attack: 5"). You might want to add a `maxHealth` member variable to make this display more informative!
* **Destructor:**
    * A `virtual` destructor. This is a best practice in C++ when a class is intended to be a base class.

### Step 2: Create Specialized Creatures using Inheritance

Now, let's create some more interesting creatures that **inherit** from `Creature`. They will have their own unique abilities. This is the core of the inheritance lesson.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Create a `Dragon` class:**
    * It should **publicly inherit from** `Creature` (e.g., `class Dragon : public Creature`).
    * Add a new private member variable: `fireBreathPower` (int).
    * Create a constructor that accepts `name`, `health`, `attackPower`, and `fireBreathPower`. It must call the parent constructor in its member initializer list.
    * **Override** the `attack(Creature* target)` method using the `override` keyword. A Dragon's attack should be its regular `attackPower` plus a random chance to use fire breath. (Use the C++ `<random>` library for this!)
    * Add a new method `breatheFire(Creature* target)` that deals `fireBreathPower` damage.

2.  **Create a `Goblin` class:**
    * It should **publicly inherit from** `Creature`.
    * Add a new private member variable: `dodgeChance` (double, e.g., 0.3 for 30%).
    * Create a constructor that calls the parent constructor.
    * **Override** the `takeDamage(int damage)` method. The Goblin should have a chance to dodge the attack. If it dodges, it takes no damage. Otherwise, it takes damage as normal.

### Step 3: Create a `BattleArena` Utility Class

This class isn't a creature; it's a "manager" or "utility" class. Its job is to control the battle. This teaches the concept of using methods outside the entity classes themselves.

**Instructions:**
Create a `BattleArena` class with a **static** member function. Static functions are perfect for utility functions that don't rely on an object's state.

* **Method:**
    * `public: static void fight(Creature* c1, Creature* c2)`: This method will contain the main battle loop.
        * The loop should continue as long as **both** creatures `isAlive()`.
        * Inside the loop, `c1` attacks `c2`, then `c2` attacks `c1`.
        * After each attack, check if the defending creature is still alive. If not, break the loop.
        * Display the status of both creatures at the end of each round.
        * After the loop ends, declare the winner!

### Step 4: Putting It All Together (The `main` Function)

Finally, create a `main` function to start the program, create creature objects, and begin the fight.

**Instructions:**
Create an `int main()` function.

1.  **Create objects:**
    * Instantiate a `Dragon` object on the stack.
    * Instantiate a `Goblin` object on the stack.
2.  **Start the battle:**
    * Call the static `fight` method from your `BattleArena` class, passing in the **addresses** of the two creatures you just created (using the `&` operator).
